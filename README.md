The program loads from a file a list of tracks and displays them on a given image.

for example:
the picture is - 
![SCREESHOT DECSRIPTION](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/xt-paths-research-ella-chani-z-chani-g-sari-v/blob/master/paths0.PNG)
and after drawing some tracks it looks like this:
![SCREESHOT DECSRIPTION](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/xt-paths-research-ella-chani-z-chani-g-sari-v/blob/master/paths.PNG)


you can choose show tracks by filters like time, date, area, and more.
you can also combine between some of the filters.
